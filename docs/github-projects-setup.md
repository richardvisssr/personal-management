## 🔧 Advanced Project Configuration

### Automation Rules

#### Auto-assign Labels
```
When: Issue is created
If: Title contains "[BUG]"
Then: Add label "bug", set priority "high"
```

#### Status Updates
```  
When: Pull request is merged
If: PR closes an issue
Then: Move issue to "Released"
```

#### Stale Item Management
```
When: Issue has no activity for 30 days
If: Status is "Backlog"
Then: Add label "stale", move to "Archive"
```
