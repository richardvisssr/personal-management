Bewezen strategieën en tips voor effectief GitHub-gebaseerd projectmanagement als solo web developer.

## 🎯 Issue Management Best Practices

### ✅ DO's

**Issue Creation**:
- ✅ **Use descriptive titles** with clear prefixes: `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[TODO]`
- ✅ **Start simple** with Simple Todo, upgrade to Feature Request when needed
- ✅ **Add acceptance criteria** - be specific about when something is "done"
- ✅ **Link related issues** using keywords: "Closes #123", "Related to #456"
- ✅ **Use labels consistently** - helps with filtering and prioritization

**Issue Updates**:
- ✅ **Comment regularly** with progress updates, even small ones
- ✅ **Change status** by moving cards between columns
- ✅ **Close promptly** when work is truly complete
- ✅ **Reference commits** that address the issue

**Issue Organization**:
- ✅ **Break large features** into smaller, manageable issues
- ✅ **Use milestones** for version releases or project phases
- ✅ **Assign realistic priorities** - not everything can be urgent
- ✅ **Review backlog weekly** to remove/deprioritize stale items

### ❌ DON'Ts

**Avoid These Mistakes**:
- ❌ **Don't create duplicate issues** - search before creating
- ❌ **Don't leave issues hanging** - close or update regularly
- ❌ **Don't over-engineer simple tasks** - not every todo needs a full feature template
- ❌ **Don't ignore stale issues** - review and clean up monthly
- ❌ **Don't mix unrelated changes** in one issue

## 🏷️ Label Strategy Best Practices

### Priority Labels Usage
```
🔴 urgent    - Same day completion needed
🟠 high      - This week completion
🟡 medium    - This sprint/month
🟢 low       - Backlog/nice to have
```

### Status Flow
```
📝 todo → 🚧 in-progress → 👀 review → ✅ done
                ↓
              🚫 blocked (temporary)
```

### Complexity Estimation
```
🟢 simple   - < 2 hours, straightforward
🟡 medium   - 2-8 hours, some research needed  
🟠 complex  - > 8 hours, significant effort
```

## 📋 Project Board Optimization

### Column Limits
- **Todo**: Max 10 items (more = analysis paralysis)
- **In Progress**: Max 3 items (focus is key)
- **Review**: Max 5 items (don't let them pile up)
- **Done**: Archive weekly (keep recent for reference)

### Card Movement Rules
- Move cards as soon as status changes
- Add comment when moving to explain context
- Don't skip columns (todo → review is red flag)
- Use blocked status when waiting on external factors

### View Usage
- **Board View**: Daily workflow and visual progress
- **Table View**: Weekly reviews and bulk updates
- **Calendar View**: Deadline planning and time management

## 🔄 Workflow Optimization

### Daily Habits
```
Morning (5 min):
- Review "In Progress" column
- Plan 1-3 focus tasks for the day
- Check for any urgent/blocking items

During Work:
- Update issues with progress comments
- Move cards when status changes
- Create new issues for ideas/bugs immediately

Evening (3 min):
- Update current work status
- Plan tomorrow's priorities  
- Celebrate completed items
```

### Weekly Habits
```
Friday (15 min):
- Review completed work (velocity check)
- Clean up "Done" column  
- Groom backlog (remove/reprioritize)
- Plan next week's priorities
```

### Monthly Habits
```
Last Friday of Month (30 min):
- Archive old completed items
- Review label usage patterns
- Update project board configuration
- Assess workflow effectiveness
```

## 🎨 Customization Best Practices

### Start Simple, Scale Up
```
Week 1: Just issue templates + basic labels
Week 2: Add simple project board
Week 3: Add custom fields and views
Week 4: Optimize based on usage patterns
```

### Personal Adaptation
**For Visual Learners**:
- Use screenshots in all issues
- Leverage project calendar view
- Create visual project roadmaps

**For Detail-Oriented**:
- Comprehensive issue templates
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Extensive custom fields

**For Speed-Focused**:
- Minimal templates
- Quick keyboard shortcuts
- Streamlined workflows

## 🚫 Common Antipatterns to Avoid

### The "Perfect System" Trap
- ❌ Spending more time organizing than working
- ✅ Start simple, improve iteratively

### The "Everything is Urgent" Problem
- ❌ Labeling everything as high/urgent priority
- ✅ Be ruthless with prioritization

### The "Stale Backlog" Issue
- ❌ Accumulating hundreds of outdated issues
- ✅ Regular backlog grooming and cleanup

### The "Analysis Paralysis" Trap
- ❌ Over-planning every small task
- ✅ Use Simple Todo for quick items

### The "Context Switch Chaos"
- ❌ Jumping between projects without documentation
- ✅ Always document "where you left off"

## 🎯 Productivity Patterns

### The "2-Minute Rule"
If a task takes less than 2 minutes:
- ✅ Do it immediately instead of creating an issue
- ✅ Exception: If it's unrelated to current focus

### The "Batching Strategy"
Group similar tasks:
- 📝 **Admin tasks** (updates, reviews) → Friday afternoon
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** → Specific days or time blocks
- 🚀 **Feature work** → Protected focus time
- 📚 **Documentation** → After completing features

### The "Definition of Done"
For every issue, be clear about:
- ✅ What functionality is complete?
- ✅ What testing has been done?
- ✅ What documentation is updated?
- ✅ What deployment steps are needed?

## 📱 Multi-Device Workflow

### Desktop (Primary)
- Full project board management
- Detailed issue creation and updates
- Code development and testing

### Mobile (Secondary)
- Quick status updates
- Idea capture during commute
- Urgent issue triage
- Progress review

### Sync Strategy
- Use GitHub mobile app for consistency
- Voice notes → transfer to issues later
- Email yourself → create issues when back at desk

## 🔧 Tool Integration Tips

### GitHub CLI Shortcuts
```bash
# Create quick issue
alias todo="gh issue create --title '[TODO]' --label 'todo,simple'"

# View your current work
alias mywork="gh issue list --assignee @me --state open"

# Quick project updates
alias board="gh project list"
```

### Browser Bookmarks
Create bookmark folder for:
- Personal dashboard
- Current project boards
- Repository shortcuts
- GitHub notification inbox

### Automation Rules
Set up automation for:
- Move to "Done" when PR is merged
- Add "in-progress" label when PR is opened
- Auto-assign issues to yourself
- Close stale issues after 30 days

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Track These KPIs
- **Issues completed per week** (velocity)
- **Time from Todo → Done** (cycle time)
- **Number of blocked items** (bottlenecks)
- **Stale issue percentage** (health check)

### Warning Signs
- 🚨 More than 5 items "in-progress" simultaneously
- 🚨 Issues sitting in "todo" for > 2 weeks
- 🚨 Backlog growing faster than completion rate
- 🚨 Spending > 10% of time on process management

## 🎓 Learning and Improvement

### Weekly Retrospective Questions
1. What workflow friction did I experience?
2. Which issues took longer than expected? Why?
3. What patterns am I seeing in my work?
4. How can I improve next week?

### Monthly Process Review
1. Is the current setup serving my productivity?
2. What features am I not using? Should I remove them?
3. What manual work could be automated?
4. How has my workflow evolved?
