## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Research question becomes too broad
2. **Technical Challenges**: Implementation proves more difficult than expected
3. **Time Management**: Falling behind on milestones
4. **Supervisor Availability**: Limited feedback during key periods

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Regular milestone reviews and scope adjustments
2. Early prototyping and technical validation
3. Buffer time built into each phase
4. Alternative communication channels and backup support
